dbstuff.py handles the connection to the MySQL server. It should usually only be used to make the source have a chance of working.

How to set up:

Edit dbstuff.py, filling in the details with your MySQL server details.

In the database, ensure that you have the following structure in a table named users:

- UserID
- Username
- Password
- EmailAddress
- things
- things
- things
- things
- things
- things
- things
- things
- things
- things
- things
- things
- PythianRealms_Last-Login

The "things" columns are where you can put whatever you want. They aren't ever going to be used by the game, but they're buffers because the game is programmed in alignment with my database. Don't simply change the index of the last login column, as I check every request and will decline any that affect that, since it would break the game. In all reality, *don't touch the MySQL code (except for dbstuff.py)* - It's hell on Earth!
